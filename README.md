# leetcode-php

A collection of my solutions to **LeetCode** problems written in **PHP**.
This repository serves as a personal archive, a learning journal, and a reference for anyone interested in solving algorithmic challenges using PHP.

## 📌 About

LeetCode offers a wide range of coding challenges covering algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more.
This repository contains PHP implementations of the problems I’ve solved, written with clean structure and idiomatic PHP patterns.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

```
